# Agile-Sprint-Simulation
A project where me and fellow team members simulated what it would be like to work on an application in an agile environment, for one sprint. Me and the team learnt how to select PBIs to work on for a sprint, as well as how to manage our development timeline in the Sprint Burndown Chart. <br><br>
We also learnt of how to write and implement test cases for the program, to ensure that the program is working as intended, according to the PBI and features and requirement.
